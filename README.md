**5. SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE**

**AIM:**

To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using Xilinx ISE.

**APPARATUS REQUIRED:**

Xilinx 14.7 
Spartan6 FPGA

**PROCEDURE:**

1. Open Vivado: Launch Xilinx Vivado software on your computer.

2. Create a New Project: Click on "Create Project" from the welcome page or navigate through "File" > "Project" > "New".

3. Project Settings: Follow the prompts to set up your project. Specify the project name, location, and select RTL project type.

4. Add Design Files: Add your Verilog design files to the project. You can do this by right-clicking on "Design Sources" in the Sources window, then selecting "Add Sources". Choose your Verilog files from the file browser.

5. Specify Simulation Settings: Go to "Simulation" > "Simulation Settings". Choose your simulation language (Verilog in this case) and simulation tool (Vivado Simulator).

6. Run Simulation: Go to "Flow" > "Run Simulation" > "Run Behavioral Simulation". This will launch the Vivado Simulator and compile your design for simulation.

7. Set Simulation Time: In the Vivado Simulator window, set the simulation time if it's not set automatically. This determines how long the simulation will run.

8. Run Simulation: Start the simulation by clicking on the "Run" button in the simulation window.

9. View Results: After the simulation completes, you can view waveforms, debug signals, and analyze the behavior of your design.

**VERILOG CODE:**

```
module fsm( clk, rst, inp, outp);
input clk, rst, inp;
output outp;
reg [1:0] state;
reg outp;
always @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
begin
if(rst)
state<=2'b00;
else
begin
case(state)
2'b00:
begin
if(inp) state <=2'b01;
else state <=2'b10;
end
2'b01:
begin
if (inp) state <=2'b11;
else state<=2'b10;
end
2'b10:
begin
if (inp) state<=2'b01;
else state <=2'b11;
end
2'b11:
begin
if (inp) state <=2'b01;
else state <=2'b10;
end
endcase
end
end
always @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
begin
if(rst)
outp <= 0;
else if(state == 2'b11)
outp <= 1;
else outp<= 0;
end
endmodule
```

**RESULT:**

Hence the finite state machine has been simulated and synthesised using vivado.
